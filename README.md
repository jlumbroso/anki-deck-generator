# Anki Penn Student Flashcard Generator

Generate Anki flashcards from a JSON file containing student data generated by [the Penn Class List Scraper](https://github.com/jlumbroso/penn-classlist-scraper).

## Overview

This project provides a web-based tool to generate Anki decks from a JSON file containing student data. The generated deck contains cards with student names and their corresponding images.

To begin, export a JSON file from the class lists. Start by installing [the Penn Class List Scraper](https://github.com/jlumbroso/penn-classlist-scraper) and then navigate to the class lists on [`courses.at.upenn.edu`](https://courses.at.upenn.edu/). After obtaining the JSON file, this tool can generate an Anki deck with cards for each student.

## Features

* Upload a JSON file containing student data.
* Generate an Anki deck with cards for each student.
* Download the generated `.apkg` file for importing into Anki.

## Setup
